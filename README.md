  1. Once you’ve finalized and saved your request in Postman, you might want to
  make the same request from your own application.
  2. Postman lets you generate snippets of code in various languages and
  frameworks that will help you do this.
  3. You’ll need to click the **Code** link under the blue Send button to
  open the **GENERATE CODE SNIPPETS modal**.
